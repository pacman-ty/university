#definition(title: "Classical (Waterfall) Life Cycle Model")[
  1. *Requirements Phase*
    - Elicit Client Requirements
    - Understand client needs
  2. *Analysis (specification) phase*
    - Analyze client requirements
    - Draft specification Documentation
    - Draft Software Project Management Plan
  3. *Design phase*
    - Design architecture: Divide software functionality into components
    - Draft detailed design for each component
  4. *Implementation phase* 
    - Coding (development): Code and document each component 
    - Unit test each individual component
    - Integration (system) testing: Combine components, test interfaces among components
    - Acceptance testing: Use live data in clientâ€™s test environment. Clients participate in testing & verification of test results, and sign off when they are happy with the results.
    - Deploy to production environment 
  5. *Post delivery maintenance*
    - Maintain the software while it's being used to perform the tasks for which it was developed
  6. *Retirement*
    - Product is removed from service: functionality provided by S/W is no longer useful / further maintenance is no longer economically feasible
]

#problem[
  Why does the Waterfall life cycle model not have any of the following phases?

  - Planning 
  - Testing 
  - Documentation
]

#solution[

  - All three activities are crucial to project success
  - Therefore all three activities must happen throughout the project and cannot be limited to just one project phase.

#definition(title: "Adaptive Maintenance")[
  1. Change the software to adapt to changes in environment (e.g. new policy, tax rate, regulatory requirements, changes in systems environment) - may not necessarily add to functionality. You allow software to survive.

  #strong[The Importance of Post delivery Maintenance]

  - Shelf life of good software: 10, 20, even 30 years

The _Classical model_ is most effective when the IT team can work without accepting change to the requirements after the requirements are complete.

Changing requirements negatively affects software:
  - Quality
  - Delivery dates 
  - Budget

#definition(title: "Regression Fault")[
  A *regression fault* occurs when a change in one part of the software product induces a fault in an apparently unrelated part of the software product

4. Open Source Life-Cycle Model
5. Agile Processes 
6. Synchronize and Stabilize Life-Cycle Model
7. Spiral Life-Cycle Model 

#definition(title: "Code and Fix Life-Cycle Model")[
  Implement the software product without requirements, specification, or design

  *Strengths:*

  1. Thus technique may work on _very small_ systems ($<= 200$ lines of code)
  2. Easy to incorporate changes to requirements
  3. Generates a lot of lines of code 

  *Weaknesses:* 

  1. This technique is totally unsuitable for systems of any reasonable size
  2. This technique is unlikely to yield the optimal solution
  3. Slow 
  4. Costly 
  5. Likelihood of regression faults is high 

  #remark[
    Only really works for user base of size 1 (e.g. assignments)

]

#definition(title: "Waterfall (modified) Life-Cycle Model")[
  Augment the "vanilla" waterfall to include feedback loops during the project, and for post delivery maintenance. No phase is complete until all its documents are complete and approved by QA 

  *Strengths:* 
  
  1. Discipline enforced by QA

  *Weaknesses:*

  1. Specification documents may not be fully understood before they are approved
  2. Finished product product may not actually meet the clients needs 
]

#definition(title: "Rapid Prototyping Life-Cycle Model")[
  A rapid prototype is a working model that is functionally equivalent to a subset of the software product 
]

#definition(title: "Open Source Life-Cycle Model")[
  1. Single individual has an idea for a program, builds initial version, makes it available free of charge to anyone who wants a copy
  2. If there is sufficient interest then users become co-developers for post delivery maintenance
  3. All participants can offer suggestions
  4. Participation is voluntary and typically unpaid
  5. Success depends on the interest generated by the initial version
  6. In direct competition with enterprise software
]

#definition(title: "Agile Process")[
  1. Communication
  2. Speed 
  3. MVP is always kept in mind

  _Requirements_
  
  - User Stories 
  - Prioritization
  - Making Backlog 

  _Sprints_

  - Daily Meetings 
  - Reassigning Tasks 

  Tries to ensure frequent delivery of new versions

  *Strengths:*
  
  1. Speed 
  2. Flexibility 
  3. Team Cohesion 
  4. Some history of success with smaller projects 

  *Weaknesses:*

  1. Heavy on meetings
  2. Not scalable with team size
]

#definition(title: "Synchronize and Stabilize Life-Cycle Model")[
  1. Pull requirements from the clients 
  2. Write specification documentation 
  3. Divide work into four builds 
    1. Critical 
    2. Major 
    3. Minor 
    4. Trivial 
  4. Carry out each build using small teams working parallel
  5. *Synchronize* at the end of each day 
  6. *Stabilize* at the end of each build  

  *Strengths:* 

  1. Users needs are met 
  2. Components are successfully integrated 
  3. Tolerant of changes to specifications 
  4. Encourages individual developers to be innovative and creative 
  5. Daily synchronization and build stabilization ensures developers will all work in the same direction 
  6. Good for large projects 
  7. Holay glaze what the jelly 

  *Weaknesses:* 

  1. Only been used successfully at Microsoft 
]

#definition(title: "Spiral Life-Cycle Model")[
  - Minimize risk inherent in software development by the use of constant *proof of concept prototypes* and other means 
  - Proof of concept aims to determine whether an architecture design is good

  We can make break this down into 

  1. Planning / Requirements
  2. Risk Analysis 
  3. Develop and Verify  
  4. Plan Next Phase 

  *Strengths:* 

  1. Emphasis on alternative sand constraints supports reuse and software quality
  2. This technique encourages doing the correct amount of testing

  *Weaknesses:* 

  1. This model is only meant for internal building of large scale software
  2. Project can look fine but really be heading for disaster 
  3. Makes assumptions that software is developed in discrete phases

#corollary(title: "Iteration and Incrementation within the Object Oriented Paradigm")[
  All variations on iteration and incrementation, including the unified process, attempt to preserve some classical structure, while being more tolerant of change than the classical model.

  1. Phases are the increments 
  2. we iterate through increments to complete the project

#definition(title: "Unified Modelling Language")[
  UML stands for Unified Modelling Language
]

#definition(title: "Model")[
  A model is a set of UML diagrams which describes one or more aspects of the software product to be developed
]

#remark[
  *What is the motivation behind these innovations*

  1. Even the best software engineers almost never get their artifacts right on the first attempt. So stepwise refinement will be needed
  2. UML diagrams are visual, hence more intuitive than block verbiage
  3. The visual nature of a UML model fosters collaborative refinement

== Summary of Requirements, Analysis, Design, and Implementation Workflows 

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Requirements Workflow*]

Requirement artifacts can be 

1. Incorrect (only client can detect this)
2. Ambiguous (e.g. AND versus OR in the inclusion criteria IT can detect this)
3. Incomplete (e.g. mission criterion to filter down to the program - only the client can detect this)
4. Contradictory (e.g. conflicting sort criteria - IT can detect this)

Using UML diagrams effectively helps to mitigate such problems with requirements

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Analysis Workflow*]

1. Analyze and refine the requirements to achieve the level of detail needed to begun designing the software and maintain it effectively later 
2. Once the analysis is complete, the cost and duration of the development are estimated $arrow.r$ create the Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)
3. Terminology: Deliverables, Milestones, and Budget

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Design Workflow*]

1. Show *how* the product is to do what it must do 
2. Refine the artifacts of the analysis workflow until the result is good enough for the developers to implement it
3. There are differences between the classical and the object oriented paradigms here
4. It is important to keep detailed records about design decisions

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Implementation Workflow*]

1. Implement the target software product in the chosen implementation language 
2. Usually code artifacts are implemented by different developers and integrated once implemented - thus design shortcomings may not come to light until the time of integration

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Test Workflow*]

1. Ensure the correctness of the artifacts from all other workflows 

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Requirements*]

1. Traceability: every later artifact must trace back to a requirement artifact 
2. Until implementation there will be no code to test, only documents. Hence we test by holding a review of the document, with the key stakeholders.

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Analysis*]

1. Tactic: Hold a review of analysis artifacts with key stakeholders chaired by QA
2. Review the SPMP too 

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Design*]

1. Design artifacts must trace back to analysis artifacts
2. Tactic: Hold a review of design artifacts

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Implementation*]

1. Some projects also incorporate *alpha* and *beta* testing 
2. Although it is tempting *alpha* testing should not replace thorough testing by the QA group 

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Post Delivery Maintenance*] 

1. This is *not* an afterthought - it must be planned from the start 
2. Pitfall: Lack of adequate documentation 
3. Testing changes must include *positive* and *regression* testing 

#definition(title: "Positive Testing")[
  Positive testing means testing that what you intended to change was changed in the desired way 
]

#linebreak()

#highlight[*Retirement*]

1. This is triggered when post delivery maintenance is no longer feasible or cost effective 
2. Usually a software product is replaced at this point
3. True retirements are rare
